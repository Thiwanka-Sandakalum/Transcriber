0,6500," At the crock, the nest's kids play basketball while sea-unwines in yoga, and on the way home,"
6500,8500," they always share tips."
8500,13500," That's why the Rod Regas family is famous around town for shooting hoops upside down."
13500,19500," They can dunk from downward dog, score three pointers from cro-posed, and make hook shots in head stands."
19500,25300," With so many activities, programs, and classes at the crock, you never know what you'll get into."
25300,27800," Join more than a gym when you click the link."
27800,29800," The crock, get into it!"
30300,38300," Mines are like parachutes, in that they function best when they're able to be opened."
38300,42300," And that is the thought for today."
42300,53300," Welcome to seven good minutes."
53300,54800," I'm Clyde Lee Dennis."
54800,61300," Thanks for joining me for what I believe will be seven of the most enriching minutes of your day."
61300,67300," In today's episode of seven good minutes, we hear about what makes a good student a good student."
67300,70300," Enjoy!"
70300,76300," Today we're going to learn about why sea students are more successful than a students."
76300,78300," Now, let's begin!"
78300,81300," Number one, innovative thinking."
81300,86300," Many of the most successful people didn't stand because of their fantastic grades,"
86300,88800," or because of their prestigious degrees."
88800,96300," They made a name for themselves by thinking differently, by pioneering an idea that brought something new to the table."
96300,102300," This is one huge reason why sea students are more successful than a students."
102300,104300," They're more innovative thinkers."
104300,110300," They may not excel at writing essays, taking notes during lectures or memorizing information from a textbook,"
110300,118300," but that's because the average student doesn't always fit the cookie cutter mold of what a smart person looks like."
118300,121300," Instead, they're more creative and inventive."
121300,125300," They learn to be clever in a way that school could never teach you."
125300,132300," That's why innovative thinking is such an incredibly common trait among the top 1% of successful people."
132300,137300," Some of them attended respected universities and earned expensive degrees,"
137300,142300," but for other successful people, school didn't really do much for them."
142300,148300," To get where they are today, they used their creative problem solving and their active imagination."
148300,153300," They're innovative brain carried them to the top of the socio-economic food chain,"
153300,159300," so don't let anyone tell you that good grades are the only way to find success."
159300,164300," The real secret has nothing to do with what letters are on your transcript."
164300,168300," Number 2. Fearless risk takers."
168300,175300," See students are not afraid to take risks. They're not intimidated by failure or worried about looking bad,"
175300,178300," because they don't expect everything to go perfectly."
178300,181300," That's where many straight-a students fall short."
181300,187300," For over a decade, they've learned one thing, working hard will get you anything you want."
187300,191300," If you do everything you're supposed to do, then success will always follow."
191300,196300," But that's not how real life works. You can try your absolute hardest."
196300,202300," You can pour your blood, sweat and tears into a project, and it can still fail miserably."
202300,208300," In fact, you might spend years failing at the same thing over and over again."
208300,211300," But see students don't mind the ups and downs."
211300,215300," While a great student might give up after their first rough patch,"
215300,218300," an average student knows what it means to struggle."
218300,222300," They know how to persevere through hardship and bad luck."
222300,228300," So when life knocks them down, see students are usually the first ones to get back up."
228300,231300," Number 3. Resume dependent."
231300,235300," Some of the best students let their grades define them."
235300,242300," Instead of searching for their own passions, these students let their achievements replace their entire personality."
242300,251300," It's almost like their whole life becomes one big resume, and everything they do, they do to make themselves look better on paper."
251300,258300," This resume dependent mindset affects everything. They're job, their friends, and even their lifestyle."
258300,262300," Because they're always thinking about how other people see them."
262300,266300," Back in school, they were rewarded for being as impressive as possible."
266300,271300," After graduation, whether they like it or not, that mentality will stick around."
271300,276300," On the other hand, see students don't care as much about impressing the rest of the world."
276300,283300," They're not worried about other people's expectations, because no one was expecting as many amazing things from them."
283300,288300," Their parents and teachers probably weren't telling them to go to Ivy League schools,"
288300,291300," or that they're destined for lifelong success."
291300,295300," So they learned how to satisfy themselves before anyone else."
295300,300300," And in the long run, that's what every successful person should be doing."
301300,304300," Number four, means to an end."
304300,309300," In the mind of a straight-a student, education may seem like the end-all beall."
309300,312300," It feels like an essential stepping stone toward your future."
312300,317300," But many average students think school is just a means to an end."
317300,322300," People like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college for that exact reason."
322300,327300," They realized that school wasn't automatically going to make them successful."
327300,331300," In retrospect, they could have graduated. They could have handled the workload,"
331300,337300," but by spending more time in class or doing homework, they were holding themselves back."
337300,343300," Yeah, I know it sounds weird to say, but school was a waste of their time."
343300,348300," So they quit. Gates and Zuckerberg poured themselves into their passion projects,"
348300,352300," and they found success by having faith in their own ability."
352300,356300," Many other average students and dropouts have followed in their footsteps,"
356300,359300," leaving school to pursue success on their own."
359300,363300," They took that leap and left their education behind."
363300,368300," They bet everything on themselves, and for many of them, it actually worked."
368300,372300," Number five, following the rules."
372300,376300," School is full of rules. Bells tell you in the eat."
376300,380300," Schedulables tell you where to go, and teachers tell you what to learn."
380300,384300," So it's no surprise that straight A students are great at following the rules."
384300,388300," In fact, they thrive in strict and disciplined environments."
388300,392300," Above average students do what they're told and rarely question authority,"
392300,397300," which can get them pretty far in life, but it can also slum down."
397300,405300," If you spend your whole life walking on the beaten path, then you'll never discover what's waiting for you out there in the wilderness."
405300,410300," And that's exactly what average students do. They don't mind breaking the rules."
410300,414300," They don't like being bossed around or trapped inside a box."
414300,420300," Sometimes that makes these students rebellious and hard to control, but on your path towards success."
420300,422300," That's a good thing."
422300,429300," They're often some of the boldest and bravest achievers because they don't follow anyone's rules, but their own."
429300,431300," Please keep in mind."
431300,434300," This is about half of the entire presentation."
434300,438300," If you're up for a treat, you should definitely listen to the whole thing."
438300,444300," You can do so by clicking the link, label View the full video on YouTube in the show notes."
444300,448300," So that does it for this episode of seven good minutes."
448300,453300," Until next time, let's be civil to one another out there."
453300,455300," Thanks for listening."
455300,458040," ( Absolutely happy music playing )"
