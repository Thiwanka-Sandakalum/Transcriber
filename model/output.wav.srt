1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 At the Croc, the Nessus kids play basketball while see on lines in yoga, and on the way

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,440
 home, they always share tips.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,560
 That's why the Rodriguez family is famous around town for shooting hoops upside down.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,480
 They can dunk from downward dog, score three pointers from crow pose, and make hook shots

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,840
 in headstands.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,680
 With so many activities, programs, and classes at the Croc, you never know what you'll get

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,680
 into.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,960
 Join more than a gym when you click the link.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,960
 The Croc.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,320
 Get into it!

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:39,320
 Minds are like parachutes, in that they function best when they're able to be opened.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:50,800
 And that is the thought for today.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,160
 Welcome to 7 Good Minutes.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,000
 I'm Clyde Lee Dennis.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,120
 Thanks for joining me for what I believe will be 7th of the most enriching minutes of your

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,120
 day.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:09,800
 In today's episode of 7 Good Minutes, we hear about what makes a good student a good student.

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
 Enjoy.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:17,200
 Today, we're going to learn about why C students are more successful than A students.

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,120
 Now let's begin.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,480
 Number 1.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,000
 Innovative Thinking.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,800
 Many of the most successful people didn't stand because of their fantastic grades or

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,360
 because of their prestigious degrees.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,800
 They made a name for themselves by thinking differently, by pioneering an idea that brought

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,920
 something new to the table.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,120
 This is one huge reason why C students are more successful than A students.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,920
 They're more innovative thinkers.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,160
 They may not excel at writing essays, taking notes during lectures or memorizing information

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,920
 from a textbook, but that's because the average student doesn't always fit the cookie-cutter

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
 mold of what a smart person looks like.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,800
 Instead, they're more creative and inventive.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,600
 They learn to be clever in a way that school could never teach you.

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,280
 That's why innovative thinking is such an incredibly common trait among the top 1% of

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,240
 successful people.

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,120
 Some of them attended respected universities and earned expensive degrees, but for other

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,320
 successful people, school didn't really do much for them.

38
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,600
 To get where they are today, they used their creative problem solving and their active

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,900
 imagination.

40
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,080
 Their innovative brain carried them to the top of the socio-economic food chain.

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,600
 So don't let anyone tell you that good grades are the only way to find success.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,680
 The real secret has nothing to do with what letters are on your transcript.

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
 Number 2.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
 Fearless Risk Takers

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,840
 See students are not afraid to take risks.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,280
 They're not intimidated by failure or worried about looking bad, because they don't expect

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
 everything to go perfectly.

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,080
 That's where many straight A students fall short.

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,400
 For over a decade, they've learned one thing.

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,880
 Working hard will get you anything you want.

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,200
 If you do everything you're supposed to do, then success will always follow.

52
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,840
 But that's not how real life works.

53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,640
 You can try your absolute hardest, you can pour your blood, sweat and tears into a project,

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,000
 and it can still fail miserably.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,840
 In fact, you might spend years failing at the same thing over and over again.

56
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,400
 But see students, don't mind the ups and downs.

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,000
 While a great student might give up after their first rough patch, an average student

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,280
 knows what it means to struggle.

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,880
 They know how to persevere through hardship and bad luck.

60
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:49,160
 So when life knocks them down, C students are usually the first ones to get back up.

61
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,600
 Number 3.

62
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 Resume Dependent

63
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,640
 Some of the best students let their grades define them.

64
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,560
 Instead of searching for their own passions, these students let their achievements replace

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
 their entire personality.

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,440
 It's almost like their whole life becomes one big resume, and everything they do, they

67
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,800
 do to make themselves look better on paper.

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,720
 This resume dependent mindset affects everything, their job, their friends, and even their lifestyle.

69
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,280
 Because they're always thinking about how other people see them.

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,520
 Back in school, they were rewarded for being as impressive as possible.

71
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,520
 After graduation, whether they like it or not, that mentality will stick around.

72
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,400
 On the other hand, C students don't care as much about impressing the rest of the world.

73
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,000
 They're not worried about other people's expectations, because no one was expecting

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,960
 as many amazing things from them.

75
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,520
 Their parents and teachers probably weren't telling them to go to Ivy League schools,

76
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,560
 or that they're destined for lifelong success.

77
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,800
 So they learned how to satisfy themselves before anyone else.

78
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,720
 And in the long run, that's what every successful person should be doing.

79
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
 Number 4.

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,520
 Means to an End

81
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,440
 In the mind of a straight A student, education may seem like the end-all be-all.

82
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,120
 It feels like an essential stepping stone toward your future.

83
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,960
 But many average students think school is just a means to an end.

84
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,880
 People like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college for that exact reason.

85
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,720
 They realized that school wasn't automatically going to make them successful.

86
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,520
 In retrospect, they could have graduated, they could have handled the workload, but by

87
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,600
 spending more time in class or doing homework, they were holding themselves back.

88
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,680
 Yeah, I know it sounds weird to say, but school was a waste of their time.

89
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
 So they quit.

90
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,840
 Gates and Zuckerberg poured themselves into their passion projects, and they found success

91
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,120
 by having faith in their own ability.

92
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,400
 Many other average students and dropouts have followed in their footsteps, leaving school

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,960
 to pursue success on their own.

94
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,680
 They took that leap and left their education behind.

95
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,880
 They bet everything on themselves, and for many of them, it actually worked.

96
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,360
 5.

97
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,520
 Following the Rules

98
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,960
 School is full of rules.

99
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
 Bells tell you when to eat.

100
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,880
 Schedules tell you where to go, and teachers tell you what to learn.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,520
 So it's no surprise that straight A students are graded following the rules.

102
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
 In fact, they thrive in strict and disciplined environments.

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,240
 Love average students do what they're told and rarely question authority, which can get

104
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,680
 them pretty far in life, but it can also slow them down.

105
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,400
 If you spend your whole life walking on the beaten path, then you'll never discover what's

106
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,560
 waiting for you out there in the wilderness.

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,320
 And that's exactly what average students do.

108
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,280
 They don't mind breaking the rules.

109
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,160
 They don't like being bossed around or trapped inside a box.

110
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,640
 Sometimes that makes these students rebellious and hard to control, but on your path toward

111
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
 success.

112
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,000
 That's a good thing.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,120
 They're often some of the boldest and bravest achievers because they don't follow anyone's

114
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,960
 rules but their own.

115
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,520
 Please keep in mind, this is about half of the entire presentation.

116
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,760
 If you're up for a treat, you should definitely listen to the whole thing.

117
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,800
 You can do so by clicking the link labeled "View the full video on YouTube in the show

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,000
 So that does it for this episode of 7 Good Minutes.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,600
 Until next time, let's be civil to one another out there.

121
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,280
 Thanks for listening.

122
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,860
 (upbeat music)

123
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,440
 (mellow music)
